CompSecAlgorithm
================

I wrote this as part of CE00360-6 - Computer System Security at Staffordshire Uni.

It's basically an implementation of a Feistel network in C#. Looks pretty secure, but there's a weakness that
it has hella repeating sequences at the current block size. I reckon it's a decent jump-off if you're rolling
your own crypto (don't BTW, that's dumb... really dumb).

As it's old uni work, IDGAF what this ends up as, ergo licenced under WTFPL.
